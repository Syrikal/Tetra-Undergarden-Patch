This mod adds the following materials from the Undergarden to Tetra:
 - Cloggrum
 - Froststeel (including Frostbite ability)
 - Utherium (including Rotbane and Bloodlust abilities)
 - Forgotten Metal (including Threnody of the Deep ability)
 - Smogstem
 - Wigglewood
 - Grongle
 - Depthrock
 - Shiverstone

Pretty much all the code is from Tetra's mickelus and the Undergarden's quek.

It is also a massive mess. This is my first mod.
